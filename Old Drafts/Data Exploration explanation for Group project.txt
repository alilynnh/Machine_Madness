only a couple of taps of your smartphone or a few clicks of your mouse. Herein lay the connundrum as well: there

- Lastly, we looked at teams who won to identify possible patterns in game statistics in order to determine which variables might be the most useful in predicting winning teams. We used this information, combined with our teamsâ€™ general knowledge of basketball, to pick the initial feature variables of our model.

following information:
