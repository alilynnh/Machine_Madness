                        <p>March Madness refers to the division one men’s college basketball tournament. 
                            It is a single elimination tournament, which means teams are matched up and the team who loses is 
                            immediately eliminated from the tournament, while the team who wins advances to the next round to 
                            play another winner. These rounds continue until a final matchup of two teams, 
                            where the winner becomes the tournament champion. This tournament starts with 68 teams, 
                            and is played over 7 rounds. As for the term “March Madness”, it was first used to refer to basketball in 1939
                            by an Illinois high school official Henry V. Porter, but the term didn’t find its way to the 
                            NCAA tournament until CBS broadcaster Brent Musburger used it during coverage of the 1982 NCAA tournament.

                            <p style="margin-left: 5%">Can machine learning be used to accurately predict outcomes of various 
                            matchups in the 2022 March Madness tournament?</p>

                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>The data used for this project was obtained from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/mens-march-mania-2022/data" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>.</p>
                    <p>The data included identifying information such as team names, unique ID numbers for each team, their locations and 
                    respective conferences, as well as their coaches. In addition to this, it contained seeding information since 
                    the 1984-85 tournament, as well as detailed results from regular seasons, conference tournaments, and previous NCAA 
                    tournaments.

                    <h2>Exploratory Analysis</h2>
                    <p>The first thing we were interested in exploring was if there were any differences in average game statistics for tournament winners compared to 
                    the rest of the teams. To do this, the champion of the 2021 NCAA tournament was identified, and the team's statistics for all 
                    of the games that the champion team played in the regular season were averaged. The 2021 regular season statistics for all other 
                    teams were then combined and averaged. It was found that the champion team had higher average values for 9 of the statistics.</p>

                    <p>In addition to looking at the differences in means, a heatmap was created to examine any relationships between the different 
                        regular seasons statistics. This was done in order to visualize any unexpected relationships that were not already assumed
                        based on the general basketball knowledge of the team.</p>

                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>The data used for the model were regular season game statistics. Because the way in which sports are played 
                        is constantly evolving, only data from 2012 and onward was used. This allowed the model to still have a significant amount
                        of data, while also ensuring that the data used was relevant. The goal of the model was to determine whether "Team A" or "Team B"
                        would win in a given matchup based on the teams' previous statistics.  
                    </p>
                    <p>A random forest classifier was used for the model. The random forest algorithm creates a random selection of decision trees, 
                        and then merges the results of the various trees. Because of this cross validation, the random forest algorithm can provide 
                        higher accuracy. In addition, random forest algorithms reduce over-fitting issues, as it won't allow over-fitting trees into 
                        the model. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>Performance</h2>
                    <p>Based on the classification report (seen below), the model achieved an accuracy of 0.62. After evaluating the accuracy of 
                         the model, the top 10 feature importances were calculated based on mean decrease in impurity. The feature with the 
                         highest importance was the number of field goals made by Team B. The feature with the second highest importance 
                         was the number of steals by Team A.
